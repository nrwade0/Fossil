# Fossil IDE

 Fortran IDE designed in MATLAB App Designer by an engineer that is tired of the command-line processes involved with learning the antiquated computer language. You can find some more specific documentation regarding Fossil in the `doc` folder, including `changelog`, `news`, `install`, and `bugs`.
 
 Future work includes:
  - v1.0 launch after completion of editor and command window
  - Complete build instructions with detailed changelogs and news
  - Allow programming language of choice f77, f90, f95, f08 in drop-down menu, if gcc compiler works on all of these.
  - Tabs include a variable explorer for the current project and a folder overview
  - Upload graphics thru MATLAB, requires sharing data between programs.
  - Ultimate goal: introduce other older languages, i.e. COBOL, Pascal, etc.
