# Known bugs/issues

1. More immediate syntax highlighter: Should place HTML <text area> in editor pane and have it refresh with `prism.js` instantly. Will take a long time to learn the `html` and `javascript` integration in `MATLAB` required to complete this. Not really on the ASAP category.
2. BUG #2
3. BUG #3
